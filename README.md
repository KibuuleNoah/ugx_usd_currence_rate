## description
I made this app at the time were my uncle needed to exchange his money from USD to UGX, but  he  needed to make that exchange when the infretion is a little bit low. So I decided to sit down and write this app to help him. Now this app is all about USD,UGX currency tracking, I used flask as it's back end and on the front end I used some little bootstrap my custom css & javascript which i wrote my self for more customization.

It extends on the following fields

web scraping with beautifulsoup,
web development (backend & frontend ),
python scripting,
Data collection
